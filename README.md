Create a CSV file from JSON Table Search Data

# Background: vHMML Data Portal and JSON

[vHMML Data Portal](https://www.vhmml.org/dataPortal) makes it possible for you to create a custom dataset for personal research or for digital humanities projects. Choose your own search criteria and then focus your search results using the same tools as in [vHMML Reading Room](https://www.vhmml.org/readingRoom/).

vHMML Data Portal also provides users with the option of exporting curated datasets or the complete vHMML Reading Room dataset. Datasets are downloadable in JSON format, which provides the widest range of options for repurposing vHMML metadata for your projects.

We have placed a [full metadata schema](https://www.vhmml.org/dataPortal/schema) for the data in vHMML Reading Room on the main landing pager of the Data Portal, or you can [download the data schema via a Google sheet](https://bit.ly/vHMMLSchema). 

HMML has uploaded sample digital humanities projects using metadata from vHMML Reading Room on its digital humanities resource site [vHMML DH](https://www.vhmmldh.org/).

# Downloading Metadata From vHMML Data Portal

One of the tools you can utilize to work with your vHMML JSON datasets, is this Python script to convert your downloaded JSON Listing data into a CSV file.

Don’t know Python? Don’t worry, you don’t have to! The nice thing about Python is that it is already installed on a Mac. But, if you don’t have a Mac, you can use a service like [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) to run the program instead.
